# hello-world

Project repository for Group 1 IT 115 Fall 2021 

- Students in IT 115 are going to add content to this project. 

- Hello, World! itself does really have to do very much. It's mostly just an excuse to make several directories of practice code we can practice managing projects on GitHub.
That being said, if you can add some fun features to the Game, please do!

- To get started with this project, you have to sign up for IT 115. Then you will be assigned to a group. Your group will contribute code to this class-level repository. 

- Users can get help with this project by posting on this technical discussion board:
